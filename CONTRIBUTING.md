## Where to Start?

- **Bug Reports**: If you find a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub page. Please include as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the bug.
- **Feature Requests**: If you have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to have a conversation about the feature before any code is written.
- **Pull Requests**: If you've fixed a bug or implemented a new feature, we welcome pull requests. 

## Development Process

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Write tests for your changes.
5.  Ensure all tests pass: `pytest`
6.  Submit a pull request.

## Code Style

Please follow the existing code style. We use `black` for code formatting and `flake8` for linting.

```bash
# Auto-format your code
black .

# Check for linting errors
flake8 .
```
