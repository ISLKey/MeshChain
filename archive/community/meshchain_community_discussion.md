**What if Meshtastic could handle private cryptocurrency payments?**

Hey everyone! I've been thinking about this and want to hear what you all think...

**The Question:**

Could we build a blockchain specifically designed for Meshtastic networks? Not Bitcoin or Ethereum (those need way too much bandwidth), but something completely new that actually fits Meshtastic's limitations.

Imagine:
- Sending money to neighbors without the internet
- Completely private transactions (nobody sees who paid who or how much)
- Confirmation in 10-20 seconds (not 10 minutes like Bitcoin)
- Using the same LoRa radio you already have

**Here's the wild part:** It would only use 1-10 kbps of bandwidth. Bitcoin needs 100+ Mbps. We're talking 10,000x more efficient.

**Why I think this could work:**

- Meshtastic already has mesh routing (messages pass through multiple nodes automatically)
- Meshtastic already has encryption built-in
- Meshtastic already discovers nodes automatically
- We just need to add a lightweight blockchain layer on top

**Real-world scenarios:**

- Rural communities trading between villages without banks
- Disaster relief – coordinating aid when infrastructure is down
- Off-grid communities building their own local economy
- Supply chains tracking goods transparently without internet

---

**The catch:**

It wouldn't replace Bitcoin for global payments. It's designed for LOCAL communities. Think of it like:
- Bitcoin = global payment network
- MeshChain = neighborhood payment network

---

**So here's what I want to know:**

1. Does this idea interest you?
2. Would you actually use something like this?
3. What problems do you see with it?
4. What would make it better?
5. Who should this be built for? (rural communities, disaster relief, off-grid folks, etc?)

I've been working on the technical design, but I want to know if this is something the community actually wants before going further.
